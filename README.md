# Programming-Project-2018

This repository contains, primarily, a jupyter notebook that answers a challenge to model and synthesise data using Python

The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to synthesis data for a real-world phenomenon that can be measured.

The criteria for this challenge are:

- to collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible
- Detail the research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook 


To run the notebook, you must have [Jupyter] https://jupyter.org/ Installed on your machine. You can install this using the [Anaconda] https://anaconda.org/ Python distribution. The notebook itself is called Model and Synthesize data using Python.ipynb http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Model%20and%20Synthesize%20data%20using%20Python.ipynb
